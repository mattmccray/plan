name: plan-workflow
description: The program/epic layer above a change-management workflow (OpenSpec by default). Use whenever the user works with a PLAN.md or talks about plans, phases, or the roadmap — starting/creating a new plan ("let's start a new plan"), checking plan status ("where are we?"), deciding what to build next ("what's next?"), advancing/landing a phase, archiving a completed plan, or validating that the plan matches reality. Carries the ubiquitous language (Plan → Phases → carried by → Changes), the discipline rules (R1–R7), the artifact shape, and the plan lifecycle. The `plan:*` commands delegate here.

# Plan — workflow

You are operating the **Plan** layer: a coarse, resumable roadmap (`PLAN.md`) that
sequences **Phases**, each **carried by** one or more **Changes**. Plan sits
*above* the change engine (OpenSpec by default); it never duplicates a change's
granular tasks. Read `DESIGN.md` in this plugin for the full rationale; this file
is the operational guide.

## Vocabulary (use exactly)

- **Plan** — the roadmap (`PLAN.md`); one active plan per program.
- **Phase** — a coarse, sequenced chunk: goal + deliverables + acceptance + status.
- **Change** — a unit of work that **carries** a phase's tasks (an OpenSpec change
  by default). Keep OpenSpec's word: *propose / apply / archive* a **change**.
- **Invariants** — the cross-cutting definition-of-done across every phase.
- **Divergence** — a recorded, signed-off deviation from a source of truth.

Linking verb: **carry** — "a phase is carried by changes."

## The discipline rules (enforce these)

- **R1 Coarse, never duplicated** — granular tasks live only in the carrying
  change. The plan states goal/deliverables(coarse)/acceptance/status. Never copy
  a task list into the plan.
- **R2 Point, don't restate** — link sources of truth; never re-explain them.
- **R3 Every phase maps to changes** — name the change(s), each with a lifecycle
  state: *not yet proposed → proposed → applying → landed → archived.*
- **R4 Status reflects reality** — keep checkboxes/status current so the plan is
  resumable.
- **R5 Divergences recorded, never silent** — write deviations inline, with
  rationale + sign-off.
- **R6 Invariants are a DoD overlay** — a phase that breaks one is not done.
- **R7 Plans are kept** — archive completed plans, never delete.

## The engine seam

The plan's header declares its change engine (`Engine: OpenSpec`). Drive whatever
is declared; **default to OpenSpec** (`openspec/changes/`, the `opsx:*`
commands). To carry a phase, propose a change via that engine. Never hard-assume
OpenSpec is the only option, but do default to it.

## Locating things

- Active plan: `PLAN.md` at the repo root (the one well-known location).
- Archived plans: `plans/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<program>.md`.
- The PLAN.md template ships with this plugin at
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/PLAN.md`.
- Change state (OpenSpec): `openspec list --json`, and the
  `openspec/changes/` + `openspec/changes/archive/` directories.

## Procedures

Each `plan:*` command runs the matching procedure. Natural language routes here
too (e.g. "let's start a new plan" → **new**; "where are we?" → **status**).

### new — start a new plan

1. **Guard the active plan.** If `PLAN.md` exists and has unfinished phases
   (`[ ]`/`[~]`), STOP and confirm intent. Offer:
   - (a) archive it as-is and **carry unfinished phases forward** into the new plan,
   - (b) archive it as-is and drop the unfinished work,
   - (c) cancel — they meant to keep working the current plan.
   If `PLAN.md` exists and is complete, archive it first (see **archive**).
2. **Discuss** (conversational, like exploring at plan altitude): the program's
   goal and scope, the sources of truth, and the sequencing strategy. Do not rush
   to write the file.
3. **Draft coarse phases** — each with a goal, an acceptance bar, and dependency
   order. Coarse only (R1): no granular task lists.
4. **Write `PLAN.md`** from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/PLAN.md`: fill the
   header (Program, Status: active, Engine, Started date, Sources of truth), list
   the phases, and mark every carrying change **not yet proposed**. State the
   cross-cutting invariants and the out-of-scope list.

### status — where are we

1. Read `PLAN.md`. Read change state via `openspec list --json` (or the declared
   engine's equivalent).
2. Report: current phase, each phase's state, the lifecycle state of each carrying
   change, and **what's next**. Surface any drift you notice (see **validate**),
   but don't fix it unasked.

### next — what to build next

1. From `PLAN.md`, find the next unstarted deliverable/phase respecting dependency
   order.
2. Summarize what it is and its acceptance bar, then **hand off to the change
   engine** to carry it — for OpenSpec, propose the change (`opsx:propose`), and
   record the change name + `proposed` state on that phase in `PLAN.md`.

### advance — land a deliverable/phase

1. Confirm the work actually landed (the carrying change applied/archived; tests
   green; acceptance met; invariants R6 still hold).
2. Update `PLAN.md`: flip the checkbox(es) to `[x]`, update the phase **Status**
   with a date and a one-line outcome, and set the carrying change's lifecycle
   state (e.g. `landed` or `archived`).
3. Record any **divergence** (R5) discovered while landing.

### archive — finalize a completed plan

1. Verify the plan is complete (all phases `[x]`, or the user has explicitly
   accepted remaining work as out-of-scope).
2. In `PLAN.md`, set **Status: complete** and stamp the **Completed** date.
3. Move it to `plans/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<program>.md` (creating `plans/archive/`
   if needed). The date is the completion date; the suffix is the program
   identity (e.g. `2026-06-11-minerva-v3.md`).
4. Offer to chain into **new** for the next program.

### validate — drift check (R3/R4)

Reconcile the plan against real change state and report mismatches; fix only what
the user approves. Check:
- every `Carried by: <name>` resolves to a real change (active or archived);
- every `[x]` phase's change is archived (not still active);
- every archived change is reflected by a `[x]`/`landed` phase (no silent drift);
- sources-of-truth links resolve.

This runs as an agent-driven check today (read `PLAN.md` + `openspec list`); a
fast CLI is a future, optional addition.

## Guardrails

- Don't violate R1: if you're tempted to paste a task list into the plan, that's
  the change's job — link it instead.
- Don't silently update status that isn't real (R4) or hide a deviation (R5).
- Keep plans prose. Don't impose a rigid schema or frontmatter.
- One active plan. Don't create a second `PLAN.md` without archiving the first.
